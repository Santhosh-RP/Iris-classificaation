The Iris dataset is a classic dataset used in machine learning for classification tasks. It's a great example to test and understand various algorithms. Here's a breakdown of the dataset:

Source: The data comes from iris flowers of three species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica.
Features: It contains four features for each flower: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, all measured in centimeters.
Size: The dataset has 150 samples, with 50 samples from each of the three iris species.
Origin: The data was first published by Ronald Fisher in 1936.
The goal of using this dataset is typically to build a model that can predict the iris species based on the flower's measurements. It's a simple but effective dataset for beginners to explore machine learning concepts like classification, visualization, and model building.
